Analyzing the top 100 songs from 2018 in the songs.db database could characterize a listener's
audio aura by examining attributes like energy, valence, and danceability, similar to Spotify
Wrapped. However, this method may not fully represent the listener due to limitations: the datase
might not reflect current preferences, relying solely on top songs may miss their entire music
taste, and interpreting the aura solely on musical features lacks context.

Improvements include using recent data, analyzing a broader music library, considering individual
preferences, and implementing a feedback mechanism for continuous refinement.
These enhancements aim to create a more accurate and personalized audio aura depiction.
